  		<h4>
    		Variables
  		</h4>
      		<p>Variables are used to label a piece of code that we will need to manipulate throughout the program. Instead of typing and retyping information, we can use variables to represent a code and store it so that we can use it later.</p>
      		<p>What a Variable Looks Like in Scratch:

            <p>Variables can be compared to the little symbols on a map that represent nearby bathrooms or gas stations.

			Robot
			<h4>
			<p> So this is my robot which gave me so much trouble when I was just tryna get the lil nasty gal to move but she wouldn't and we didn't actually save our legitimate light show or got our "Super Mario" theme song to play on the piezo. We decided just to last-minute program some LEDs to alternate blinking for this video.
