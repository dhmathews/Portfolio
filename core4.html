  		<h4>
    		Variables
  		</h4>
      		<p>Variables are used to label a piece of code that we will need to manipulate throughout the program. Instead of typing and retyping information, we can use variables to represent a code and store it so that we can use it later.</p>

            <p>Variables can be compared to the little symbols on a map that represent nearby bathrooms or gas stations.
